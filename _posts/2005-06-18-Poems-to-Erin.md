title: Poems to Erin
---
I've been writing poems to my girlfriend, who is in Ecudador for the summer. Here is the first:


So sleep my dear, so fair, but far,
our love continues on,
Love as this no mean space can mar
Or time destroy, anon.


The second:
So sleep my sweet, so fair, but far,
So far beyond the sea,
Soon to return past waves that bar,
Great width 'ween you and me,

And Again:
So sleep my sweet, so fair but far
And know that I love thee
May this night shine with many a star
That both of us will see
