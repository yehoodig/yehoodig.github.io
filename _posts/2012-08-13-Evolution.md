title: Evolution

1. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is ridiculed by biological scientists so that it cannot be used to criticize Evolution.
2. But let us use Occam's Razor with respect to speciation:
   a. There is a limit to a species' variability.
      Mules cannot breed, but they are not cats.  They are of the horse kind.  Horses and donkeys will never be so far removed that they are not horselike.
      Fruit flies will always be fruit flies, no matter how many mutations they acquire.

      Some logic arithmetic:
      Premise 1: Species never gain more genetic information than they originally had.
      Premise 2: Species tend to lose genetic information over time.
      Conclusion: Earlier forms had more genetic information.

   b. Premise 1: Sub-species never contain more (but rather always less) genetic information than their predecessors.
      Premise 2: Sub-species are more specialized than their predecessors.
      Conclusion: Specialization is the result of lost information.


Earlier forms carried the genetic information to produce later forms.  What we call evolution is the result of lost information, not gained information.
The original primordial form os a creature contained all the information needed to produce all its sub-species.  A sub-species does not contain as much genetic information as the primordial form.

Genetic information tends toward disorder, disorganization and loss(entropy), just like all forms of information.

The Second Law arguments are supported by the evidence.
