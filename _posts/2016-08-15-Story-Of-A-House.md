title: Story of A House
---

	I am a house.  Over time many things have come to live in me.  One day a man came and knocked on my door, and said, “You are my house.  I bought you, I have paid for you, you belong to Me.  …May I come in?”  I said, “Of course, Sir.”

	He came in.  He saw my peeling paint, my tarnished door knobs, and frayed carpet.  He sought to open my closets, but I said, “Sir, these are my secret places.  Please do not look in here, I am not presentable.”  He said, “You are MY house.”  I opened the doors.  He found all my “friends”.

	The rats in the basement, the pigeons in the attic, the hobos squatting in the master bedroom.  He found all the things that had taken residence over the years: Depression, Anger, Fear, Debauchery and Drunkenness.  My Lord went from room to room and saw all.

	After this, He said, “They must go.  All the illegal residents, the rats, the pigeons, all the smut and soil.”  But as He spoke, Panic and Lies rushed over to speak with me and said, “But House, have we not been your Companions these many years?  What will you do without us, your friends?  Do not let this interloper throw us out, into the cold, to be homeless.  We love you, House.”

	I turned and spoke again to Jesus, and said, “It is true, these have been my Companions for many years.  Please, must they go?  Can’t Depression, Fear, and Debauchery stay?  Or, perhaps even just Depression.  Isn’t he harmless enough?  He may not be good company, but he’s all I have.  I really think I need a friend to stay.  If all these truly must go, then who or what will you give me to replace them?”

	My Lord, rose to speak and said, “Oh, my foolish house.  Do you not see, that all these are NOT your friends?  Look around at how they have ruined you.  Yes, they have been here a long time, but they are your captors, your jailers, enemies to all that is good for you.

	They are NOT good.  Their absence would be a great blessing to you.  Therefore, I offer this to you in exchange for these enemies of yours: Nothing.  Because, nothing is better than the something you now have.  Let me empty this house.  Let me remove those that do not belong here.  Let me tear down the rotten plaster and rip up the stinking carpet.  How can I bring in good things unless the evil things are first removed?

	All I ask is that you count these things as enemies, and do not welcome them in again.  But if you do, do not hide it from Me, when you see what you have done.  Instead, confess it and I will expel them again.”
