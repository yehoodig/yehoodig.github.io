title: Trip to the UK
---

Basic outline: I was not sure where I was going to go.  I only planned about 2-3 days ahead, at most.
I landed at Heathrow in the early afternoon of May 31, and made my way to Greenwich Park, in time to visit the Royal Observatory!
I was particularly excited to view the clocks.  Also walked down to the Thames and saw the Cutty Sark, and had a very touristy helping of fish and chips for dinner.

Next morning about 4 am (Sat Jun 1) I left for St. Pancras station to take the bullet train through the Chunnel to Paris (Gard-du-Nord).
Lovely City!  Mostly shutdown for the nominal [riots](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-protests/turnout-at-frances-yellow-vest-protest-hits-fresh-low-idUSKCN1T23DX).  I did not see anything myself, so I do not know what the fuss was about.  The police were out in force though.
Some delightful parks, and monuments.  I finally understand why people like it so much.  Although, I still would not claim to be a Franco-phile.  Everyone seemed pretty nice to me, but I also did not eat at any cafes.

At noon, I took a nap under the gaze of the Eiffel Tower.

I was back aboard the train to London by 8:30pm and in bed in my hostel by midnight, then up again at 6am for the trip to Edinburgh from King's Cross station.  And yes, I have a picture of platform 9 3/4. (Sun Jun 2)

Edinburgh...Oh, there is so much to say about that place.  Broad outline: Formerly known as "Old Reekie", castle at the top of the crag, is actively manned military installation.  At the bottom of the "tail" is Holy Rood Palace.  The Monarch's home in Scotland.  Home to 5 universities and the Scottish reformation.  A very intellectual city.

Stayed at the High Street Hostel.  Interesting place.  Met some interesting people.

Also visited Stirling and Falkirk while staying in Edinburgh.  Antonine Wall.  Church of the Holy Rude.

Stayed in Edinburgh 3 nights: Sunday(Jun 2), Monday(Jun 3), Tuesday(Jun 4).

On Wednesday the 5th, I traveled to Carlisle and spent the day riding the train and bus along Hadrian's Wall.
Thursday(Jun 6) I left for Bath and the South West.  Changed trains in Bristol. Stayed at the Rose and Crown, Hinton Charterhouse a village about 5 miles south of town.  I met an interesting old woman on the train who was intent on instructing me about the invasion of Normandy.  Which reminds me, my trip co-incided with President Trump's.
Friday (Jun 7), took a day trip to Glastonbury.
Saturday (Jun 8), finally made my way to London!  Wandered into the Queen's birthday celebration at Buckingham Palace!  But, missed the changing of the guards. ;)

Sunday (Jun 9), visited Riverside Vineyard Church near Heathrow, and made my way to Speaker's corner in Hyde Park.  Had a lovely long chat with 2 atheists; Andy and Eric(?).

Monday (Jun 10), had a quick stop off at Windsor Castle and then (tired and homesick), made my way to the airport to relax in the terminal and wait.
