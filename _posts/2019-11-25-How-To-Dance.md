title: How to Dance
---

I love to dance.  Dancing is a visible manifestation of the relationship between a man and a woman.  Which is why I don't dance anymore.  I don't feel right dancing with anyone but my wife.

There are two things that make a good dancer.  Frame and Connection.  Frame is a dancers posture and Connection refers to the points where the man and the woman are joined into union.

A follow who is limp is of no use to anyone.  If you have a woman with no frame, arms limp and floppy there can be no connection, no communication with her.  A leader dancing with a woman like this will be frustrated and tired, from working SO HARD to get her to MOVE.  He must exaggerate his movements and throw his weight around.  He will look like a bully, he is a bully, he may even end up hurting his partner.  Or, at the very least, end up in places that are none of his business.

No good partnership ever involves either party being utterly yielding and limp.  There MUST be some amount of resistance.  A good relationship may even appear antagonistic at times.  The defining feature of a good dancer, lead or follow, is a firm, but yielding frame.  You know where they are, where to find them, you never have to go looking, and you know what they will do when you apply pressure.

This is called a "lead".  If the leader and the lady are holding hands, and the leader draws her hand toward himself, it is his intention, and expectation that she draw near.  He does not just want her hand, he wants ALL of her.  Her hand draws her forearm, her forearm draws her upper arm, her upper arm, the shoulder and the shoulder the whole body.  If any one of these elements goes limp the whole chain of communication fails, and the lead is thwarted.

The key, to being a good follow is to provide resistance (in the sense of giving him a surface to push) to your partner.  The hand WILL NOT move without the arm and the arm WILL NOT move without the shoulder and the shoulder WILL NOT move without the rest of the body.  If it is not this way, you are dealing with a dead body, or might as well be.

If you are ever following a leader, and he is leading poorly, the best thing to do, in fact the only thing that you have a right to do, is follow his lead.  If you follow well and he leads poorly, it is likely that he will end up on his face or with your elbow in his eye, because he was not expecting you to actually do what he told you to, and thus did not bother to get out of the way.  Depending on his character, it is very possible that you will get the blame for his injuries, nevertheless he might, possibly, if we are all VERY lucky not do it again and that will be good for everyone.
