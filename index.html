  <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Home educated through 12th grade.  University of Idaho grad, with a degree in Microbiology and a minor in Chemistry.  Stay-at-home Dad and US Navy husband for 4 years, before becoming the senior cellar rat at WineBoss in Richland, WA USA.  Bible obedient Christian.

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p><em>Computer programming.</em>  Took 2 years as a computer science major at U of I. Have a fairly major project in Java, and another in "Kerboscript".  Acquainted with <em>many</em> other languages, including: bash, batch, C/C++, HTML, javascript, markdown, php, tex, eLisp, Vimscript and recently: Jekyll and Liquid.  I run Linux Mint on my custom built rig.</p>
<p><em>Orbital Mechanics and Spaceflight.</em>  I discovered a wonderful little space-flight simulator several years ago, and as a result I have had the pleasure of learning the in's and out's of rocket science and space-navigation, including efficient lifter design, computer controlled launch systems and studies in several fields of mathematics, including spherical trigonometry, ballistics and other space-flight dynamics.</p>
<p><em>Social Dancing.</em>  I whiled away many hours learning and practicing the many very fine American Vernacular Improvisational Partner Social Dances, especially the Lindy Hop, but also including East Coast Swing, the Foxtrot, Waltz, Tango, Cha-Cha/Mambo/Salsa, and Polka.</p>
<p><em>Travel.</em> 2 years in Japan as a US Navy husband, Israel for pleasure, India as part of a mission trip, and recently: England, Scotland and Paris.</p>
