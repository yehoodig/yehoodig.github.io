      </ul>
    
    
    
    </div>
    <div id="procedure-header"><h3>Procedure:</h3></div>
    <div id="procedure"><p>Dissolve the yeast in 3/4 cup warm water.  <br/>
Stir in 2 2/3 cups more warm water and everything except the flour.  <br/>
Then add the whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour.  <br/>
Keep adding more flour until it is "easy to handle".</p><br/>
<p>Put the dough on a clean surface that has been powdered with flour.  <br/>
Knead until "smooth and elastic", it should be retaining it's shape.  <br/>
<strong>The less you mix and knead, the moister the bread will be.</strong>(But it will also be more crumbly, personally I think moister bread has better flavor as well.)<br/>
Put into a greased(Olive oil or butter) bowl, and make sure it gets lightly coated with the grease.<br/>
This can be done by putting it in the bowl and then turning it over, <em>or</em> by lightly brushing oil(or melted butter) onto the<br/>
 dough with a pastry brush.  <br/>
Let rise about an hour.</p><br/>
<p>Jab the dough with two fingers, if the divot stays, punch down the dough, <br/>
mixing in the smaller bubbles and popping the bigger ones.  <br/>
Cut in half, a butter knife works surprisingly well.  <br/>
Shape each half into loaves and place each into greased bread pans, grease the loaves(same as above, olive oil or butter and a pastry brush).  <br/>
Let rise another hour, (err on the sooner side.)<br/>
The loaf should end up peaking about 1-2 inches above the pan.</p><br/>
<p>Place in oven with the top of loaf in the middle of the oven. <br/>
Bake at 375 for 30-35 minutes, until deep golden brown and hollow sounding when thumped.</p>   <br/>
<p>One last thing, if you brush the tops of the loaves with butter or oil as soon as they come out, the crust will be much softer.</p>                             </div>
